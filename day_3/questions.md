## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.  

A conditional statement resolves to true or false depending on the state of the code when it runs.  

    -`( true == false )`, resolves to `false` since they are not equal  
    -`( positiveInteger >= nonNegativeInteger && ( booleanVariable ) )`, resolves to true if and only if `booleanVariable` is truthy and `positiveInteger` is greater than or equal to `nonNegativeInteger`  
    -`( numberOfFingers === 5 )` resolves to `true` if `numberOfFingers` is the number `5`  

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?  

    You don't always want to run every piece of code available, so an if-statement allows you to run it only when appropriate.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?  
``` JavaScript
if ( < conditional statement > ){
  [block of code]
}
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?  

  You could nest if-statements, or you can use 'and', 'or', or 'xor' operators to link conditional statements.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?  

``` JavaScript
if ( < conditional statement > ){
  [code]
}
else if ( < conditional statement > ) {
  [code]
}
....[some number of else-if-statements]
else {
  [code]
}
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?  

How long to run a loop for.
